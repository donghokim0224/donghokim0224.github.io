Let $a, b \in \NN$ be relatively prime. Previous work showed that exactly one of the two equations $ax + by = (a − 1)(b − 1)/2$ and $ax + by + 1 = (a − 1)(b − 1)/2$ has a nonnegative, integral solution; furthermore, the solution is unique. Let $F_n$ be the $n^{\text{th}}$ Fibonacci number. When $(a, b) = (F_n, F_{n+1})$, it is known that there is an explicit formula for the unique solution $(x, y)$. We establish formulas to compute the solution when $(a, b) = (F_n^2, F_{n+1}^2)$ and $(F_n^3, F_{n+1}^3)$, giving rise to some intriguing identities involving Fibonacci numbers. Additionally, we construct a different pair of equations that admits a unique positive (instead of nonnegative), integral solution.
