I am a fifth-year undergraduate at UC Berkeley studying mathematics and computer science. My research interests lie broadly in arithmetic geometry and number theory, with a particular focus on modular forms and elliptic forms. Currently, I am interested in understanding the deep relationships between modular forms and elliptic curves.
